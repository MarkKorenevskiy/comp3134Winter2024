Server Port:
A server port is a logical construct that
represents an endpoint for communication in
a network. In networking, a port is a software-based
mechanism that allows multiple processes or services
to share a single physical connection to the network.
It is identified by a numerical value known as the port number.

Server Port Range:
The server port range refers to the set of port
numbers available for use on a server. In the context
of TCP/IP networking, valid port numbers range from
0 to 65535. Ports up to 1023 are well-known ports,
often reserved for common services, while ports from
1024 to 49151 are registered ports, and ports from
49152 to 65535 are dynamic or private ports.

Number of Bits:
16 bits. The number can range from 0 to 65535
